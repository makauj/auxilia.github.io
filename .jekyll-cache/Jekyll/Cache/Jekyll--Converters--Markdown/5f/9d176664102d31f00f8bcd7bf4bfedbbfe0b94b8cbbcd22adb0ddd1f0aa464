I"ÿ<p>As a ‚Äútechnology person‚Äù (ugh), people ask my why I wear a mechanical watch when I already have the time on my phone?</p>

<p>I love mechanical watches for a number of reasons ‚Äì the art, the science, the ingenuity behind the mechanisms, the continuation of a craft dating back centuries, the look, the feel, the freedom from batteries and tethers and cords.</p>

<p>But lately it‚Äôs really come down to this: When I look at my watch, it gives me the time. It asks nothing in return. It‚Äôs a loyal companion without demands.</p>

<p>In contrast, if I look at my phone for the time, it takes my time. It tempts me. The time is paired with notifications. The time is paired with a big color screen. The time is paired with a temporary cure for boredom. It seduces. It‚Äôs a rare moment that you look at your phone and you only see the time. I don‚Äôt like that trade.</p>

<p>I use my phone when I need what my phone does. I use my watch when I need the time. I like being on time, I like knowing where I stand in the hour, in the morning, in the afternoon, in the day. I look at my watch a lot, and I just love that it doesn‚Äôt look back.</p>
