They spread rapidly, infect you until you’re covered in sores and can’t do anything useful, and ultimately fill the streets with corpses.</p> <p>Ok, maybe emails aren’t exactly like the plague.</p> <p>But they do give us a crippling sense of overwhelm. From notifications to newsletters to work emails to unsolicited offers from rich princes in Nigeria, we are drowning in email after email after email…</p> <p>This emailpocalypse has inspired a number of apps and services aimed at helping us deal with them. These include Gmail, Apple Mail, Spark, Airmail and Edison Mail. They all offer a veritable assortment of features both freely and paid via subscriptions.</p> <p>Spark is my favourite of these apps. It’s a freemium cross-platform email app that enhances the email experience with a number of features, such as customisable swipe gestures, a smart unified inbox, email snoozing, customisable notifications and email pinning, among others.</p> <p>As per their tagline, Spark aims to help you love your email again. It does this by simplifying the email workflow from viewing to composing to tracking important emails via pinning or snoozing. It’s available for iOS, iPadOS, macOS and Android. A Windows app is also in the works.</p> <p>Let’s have a closer look at it and it’s features.</p> <h1 id="inbox">Inbox</h1> <p>The main screen is a list of your emails currently in Inbox. It’s divided into sections, depending on whether you have Smart Inbox enabled or not.</p> <div class="media multiple"> <img src="/assets/foto/varie/lazyload.png" data-src="/assets/foto/articolo/spark/inbox_view.jpeg" alt="" class="lazyload" /> <div class="caption"> <h3>Smart Inbox &amp; Normal Inbox views. </h3> </div> </div> <p>When Smart Inbox is enables, the list is divided into:</p> <ul> <li>People</li> <li>Notifications</li> <li>Newsletters</li> <li>Pins</li> <li>Seen</li> </ul> <p>These categories can be enabled in Settings under Smart Inbox. When Smart Inbox is disabled, you have:</p> <ul> <li>Today</li> <li>Yesterday</li> <li>Last 7 Days</li> <li>Monthly view</li> </ul> <p>This view is also used in the sidebar folders.</p> <h1 id="email-view">Email View</h1> <p>Tapping an email opens it with the title front and center, with buttons for adding a team member and pinning the email at the top right. A pinned email is displayed prominently at the top in the Smart Inbox view and under the pinned folder in the sidebar.</p> <div class="media multiple"> <img src="/assets/foto/varie/lazyload.png" data-src="/assets/foto/articolo/spark/open_email.jpeg" alt="" class="lazyload" /> <div class="caption"> <h3>Left: Open email view. Right: Email view with collapsed toolbar.</h3> </div> </div> <p>The toolbar at the bottom is customisable with the following buttons:</p> <div class="media single"> <img src="/assets/foto/varie/lazyload.png" data-src="/assets/foto/articolo/spark/toolbar_buttons.jpeg" alt="" class="lazyload" /> <div class="caption"> <h3>Toolbar buttons.</h3> </div> </div> <p>You can create a link to the email and share it with anyone, giving them access to the email without forwarding it to them. Snoozing an email removes it from the Inbox and returns it at the time of your choosing across all your devices, with optional notifications when this happens. This can be useful when you receive an important email you’d like to handle later.</p> <div class="media multiple"> <img src="/assets/foto/varie/lazyload.png" data-src="/assets/foto/articolo/spark/inbox_menu_and_snoozing.jpeg" alt="" class="lazyload" /> <div class="caption"> <h3>Email menu and email snoozing.</h3> </div> </div> <p>You can also send an email to other apps using the Services menu. For instance, you can convert an email to a Things task with a link that takes you back to the email in Spark when clicked. Spark offers integration with services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Trello, Todoist, Asana and OneNote.</p> <p>Lastly, you can Resend an already sent email to another recipient without composing it anew.</p> <h1 id="composing-emails">Composing Emails</h1> <p>Composing emails is done by tapping the big blue button at the bottom right corner. This opens a window with a cancel button, the email you’re sending from at the top, and a send button. The sending email address can be changed by tapping the email address and selecting from any of your currently logged in addresses. Tapping the close button provides a menu for minimising, saving or deleting the draft.</p> <div class="media multiple"> <img src="/assets/foto/varie/lazyload.png" data-src="/assets/foto/articolo/spark/compose_and_dismiss.jpeg" alt="" class="lazyload" /> <div class="caption"> <h3>New email composing screen and dismiss options.</h3> </div> </div> <p>The toolbar at the bottom has 6 buttons:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Attachment</strong>: You can attach photos and documents via the Files app. Spark provides a carousel of recent photos at the top for easy attaching. You can also take a photo from this screen and attach it to the email.</li> <li><strong>Templates</strong>: Templates make composing emails a breeze. You just select the template from the list and fill in the missing info.</li> </ul> <div class="media multiple"> <img src="/assets/foto/varie/lazyload.png" data-src="/assets/foto/articolo/spark/compose_attachments_and_templates.jpeg" alt="" class="lazyload" /> <div class="caption"> <h3>Left: Add attachements to email. Right: Use a template for quick email creation.</h3> </div> </div> <ul> <li><strong>Text Editor</strong>: This provides editing options such as bold, italic, font size &amp; colour, changing font, creating lists and adding links.</li> <li><strong>Set a Reminder</strong>: This gives you the option of setting a reminder to a sent email for following up later on.</li> <li><strong>Send Later</strong>: This allows you to schedule an email for sending later if your email server supports it.</li> <li><strong>Invite Teammate</strong>: Spark offers Team collaboration features that allow you to share emails with your team members. You can use this button to invite your team members to the email thread.</li> </ul> <div class="media multiple"> <img src="/assets/foto/varie/lazyload.png" data-src="/assets/foto/articolo/spark/compose_reminder_and_send_later.jpeg" alt="" class="lazyload" /> <div class="caption"> <h3>Email reminder and send later function.</h3> </div> </div> <h1 id="sidebar--calendar">Sidebar &amp; Calendar</h1> <p>The sidebar displays all your email accounts and their associated folders. Like almost everything in Spark, the folder list is highly customisable. You can add and remove folders such as Pinned, Archive, Sent and Spam, as well as rearrange them to suit your needs.</p> <div class="media multiple"> <img src="/assets/foto/varie/lazyload.png" data-src="/assets/foto/articolo/spark/sidebar_and_calendar.jpeg" alt="" class="lazyload" /> <div class="caption"> <h3>Customisable sidebar and inbuilt Calendar view.</h3> </div> </div> <p>The Calendar screen displays the calendar entries from your currently logged in accounts.

Right: Email viewer options.</h3> </div> </div> <h2 id="services">Services</h2> <p>One of Spark’s unique features is integration with multiple 3rd party services for processing your emails. You can send them to online file storage services like Dropbox and Google Drive as well as task management systems like Asana, Trello, Things and Todoist.</p> <div class="media multiple"> <img src="/assets/foto/varie/lazyload.png" data-src="/assets/foto/articolo/spark/email_services.jpeg" alt="" class="lazyload" /> <div class="caption"> <h3>Available email services.</h3> </div> </div> <h2 id="smart-inbox">Smart Inbox</h2> <p>You can enable what categories are shown in the Smart Inbox view.</p> <h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2> <p>Spark supports light and dark themes that can be synchronised to the devices dark theme settings.</p> <div class="media multiple"> <img src="/assets/foto/varie/lazyload.png" data-src="/assets/foto/articolo/spark/smart_inbox_and_appearance.jpeg" alt="" class="lazyload" /> <div class="caption"> <h3>Smart Inbox options and appearance settings.</h3> </div> </div> <h2 id="swipes">Swipes</h2> <p>This provides swipe actions on emails.
